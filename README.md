# Realtimebustracker
## This webpage will show the user the stops a bus makes between MIT and Harvard. 
# How to Run
## The user will click the button that says "show stops between MIT and Harvard" and then watch the different map markers get placed.
# Future Improvements
## Update the stops if the bus changes its stopping points. Add more busses and their routes.
# Quick Access
